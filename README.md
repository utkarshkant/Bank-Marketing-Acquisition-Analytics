# Bank Marketing Acquisition Analytics

## Objective
- A Portuguese bank has run a tele-marketing campaign for selling their term deposit product.
- The objective is to reduce the customer acquisition cost (CAC) by targetting the ones who are likely to buy and to improve the response rate, i.e., identify and classify the prospects that respond the best to the marketing campaign.
- The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) to the term deposit.
